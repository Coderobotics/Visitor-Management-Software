# Visitor-Management-Software
<b>C#.Net based Visitor Management Software</b>

VMS is a desktop visitor management application that can be installed on one or more Windows PCs and tablets. Visitor management is the process of tracking everyone who enters your building or your office. A visitor may be a customer, a delivery person, a job applicant, a contractor, a consultant. Essentially, anyone who is not a regular full-time employee is a visitor. The old-fashioned version of a visitor management system is the sign-in sheet — a piece of paper usually kept on a clipboard or in a binder at the front desk. When a visitor arrives, they write down their name, who they’re there to see, and the time. Today, companies are eschewing binders, pens, and paper in favor of digital visitor management systems, like The Receptionist for iPad. A digital visitor management system does the core job of checking in visitors. But it also does many things a pen and paper can’t. Our VMS is developed in C#.Net with MSSQL which helps small, medium based companies to manage their visitors simply and effectively.
